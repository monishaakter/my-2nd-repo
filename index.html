    <h3>Paragraph Bangladesh</h3>
    <p>My country is Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a Southeast Asian country. It is small country but huge population. It gains independence twice. Once from Britain in 1947 and again from Pakistan in 1971. Dhaka is the capital of this country. More than twenty crore people live in our country. Most of them are Muslims. Others are Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Most of the peopleâ€™s occupation of our country are farmers. Remaining people are doctors, engineers, teachers, businessmen, jobbers 

        <h3>Our National Flag Paragraph</h3>
        <p>Our national flag is the symbol of our independence and sovereignty. We got independence through a bloody liberation war and we have lost millions of lives in the war. That is how we earn our national flag. This is a matter of our emotions and pride. Every independent country in the world has its own national flag. We also have our national flag which is rectangular. There is a certain ratio to make our national flag. Its length and width ratio should be 10:6. It can be made of different materials like cotton, silk or linen. The rectangular background is green in color. There is a circle inside the rectangle and that is red in color. There are some reasons for this color scheme. The green background reminds us of our green motherland. As we are a country with green lands and crops everywhere, this green background is the symbol of our land. It is also the symbol of our evergreen youth that want to take the country far. It also reminds us of the valiant struggle of our evergreen youth that gave us independence. The red circle in the middle is the symbol of the glowing sun that gives energy to all of us. It also has another symbolic meaning that is tragic. We have lost millions of lives during our liberation war</p>
